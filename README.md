- Decentralized Machine Learning

Data is becoming more open and accessible across the research community but most data still remains locked away or allows access to a privileged few.  Smart Contracts used as permission gateways is a proposed solution to this problem and at the same time empowers all in the network to take ownership of their data. How do decentralized storage protocols work and coordinate with smart contracts? Computations need to be performed, again new decentralized compute protocols are emerging, how do they bring new rigor to science?
